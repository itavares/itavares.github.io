## About Me

I am currently a software/cybersecurity engineer at a small company called EWR Radar Systems. We work making mobile/tactical weather radars. My main job at this place is to develop new software for our radars, create new tools for production automation and perform vulnerability scans, system hardening and ensure all our systems are DoD compliance. The list is long, but I do a little bit of everything right now.

Here are some more information about myself:
- B.S Computer Science
- M.S Cybersecurity Engineering
- CompTIA Security+ Certified
- Volunteer at ShellCon 2019
- Former Head TA of System Security Class
- Survived 3 Defcons (27,28(online),30)

## About CTF
I am a vivid CTF player. My focus when I play, are in the Forensics, System Exploitation, Steganography, OSINT and Network analysis areas. I helped create a CTF team at my University Team [BearShell](https://wustl-bearshell.github.io/), and recently have created a team of friends who graduated with me so we can continue to play when we have time.

Here are a couple accomplishments playing CTF:
- Top 5% Cyber Hacktics Hacktober [2020]
- 1st STLCybercon CTF [2019]
- 4th STLCyberUP NCSAMCTF [2019]

Platforms:
- Top 1% in THM ([tryhackme.com](tryhackme.com))
