# Hello There

## I am Ighor Tavares, known as sum_b0dy on twitter...

I have always struggled getting my own website going. I usually either give up, or I try to make it too nice, and never come back to finish it. Well, this time is a little bit different. Got my own domain, selected a framework to make my life easier ([gohugo.io](gohugo.io)), and I am hosting somewhere where I don’t have to deal with it too much, since this is a static website (yay). 

My plan is to mainly use this as a quick introduction to who I am (I mean, you can see that too at LinkedIn right?), and post more personal stuff. Also, tools. I don’t have many now, but I am starting to realize I make a lot of small tools, for work, CTF, and day-to-day life. So why not just share it here? Maybe someone has some use for them. I don’t know.

Well, this makes it official, I guess.

Cheers and Happy Hacking!
