      <description>XORed This is a small tool I made to perform XOR operations on a binary file using Golang. Find it at my github: xored.go
The motive to create this tool (it&amp;rsquo;s very simple honestly) happened while solving a threat hunting CTF problem where I was tasked to find the binary in a pcap file. The neat part was that the binary was &amp;ldquo;hidden.&amp;rdquo; The attacker performed an XOR operation to hide it, so to get the original binary, I would have to undo the operation.</description>
